1. Can we do booking detail is editable after payment done?. 

2. If booking is editable then we can increase decrease days, issue arises in payment and bill.

3. In new booking today's date is accepted in UPTO DATE input. it is not a problem, 
    but if FORM DATE is greater than UPTO DATE bill amount and days goes in minus.
    Ex.  if FORM DATE 2019/07/17 and UPTO DATE (todays date) 2019/07/11 then no of days
         -6 and bill amount goes in minus as -21000.

4. If Room type is deleted from table then record regarding that id shown on dashboard 
   Rooms Details with blank typename. 

5. If room amenity is deleted from amenities list then it should be delete from Room_amenities table.
    because if it is used in room details form then it fetched as null and show in edit room 
    detail form.

6. If Payment Type is DELETED then it fetch as null in its all regarding records.
